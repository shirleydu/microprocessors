Intro:

This lab explores the interfacing of the c8051 microcontroller with different types of external RAM. External memory can be accessed using Ports 5 and 6 as an address bus, Port 7 as a data bus, and P4.6 and P4.7 as read and write enables respectively. The addresses 0x0000 to 0x1FFF are internal to the c8051, after which the microcontroller looks to external memory. The two types of RAM used for this lab were the Am9128, a 2k x 8-bit memory chip, and the MCM6147, a 4k x 1-bit memory chip.
